# ToDoHub

**By Sebastian Inaba**

ToDoHub is a full-stack task management web application built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Express, MongoDB and Supabase. The project demonstrates secure user authentication, CRUD functionality, responsive design, and a clean UI built from scratch.

---

### Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (Vanilla)
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js
- **Database:** MongoDB + Mongoose
- **Authentication & Security:** bcrypt (password hashing), JSON Web Tokens (JWT), cookie-parser, express-rate-limit, express-mongo-sanitize, cors, validator
- **Image Handling:** multer (file upload), sharp (image conversion to WebP)
- **Image Storage:** Supabase Storage
- **Design and Font:** Figma, Font awesome, Poppins (SIL Open Font License)
- **Utilities:** dotenv, nodemon

## Design

### Original Figma Design

![Original Figma Design](githubImages/figmaDesign.png)

Designed to explore various aspects of web development, the layout focuses on accessibility, mobile-first responsiveness, and simplicity.  
However, it is by no means finished, and the current design will most likely not be the final product.

---

## Features (So Far and Things to Note)

- âœ… User registration and login with tokens and hashed passwords
- âœ… JWT tokens and refreshTokens use http-only cookies
- âœ… Profile picture upload and storage via Supabase with webP conversion
- ðŸŸ¥ Refresh tokens are currently handled in a single POST route. While this works for basic auth, a more secure approach would be to store refresh tokens in a database, allowing you to track IP addresses, detect suspicious activity, and blacklist tokens when needed.
  However, it's probably better to set up authentication with a hosted service (like Firebase Auth, Supabase Auth, etc..) to reduce complexity and improve security with monitoring.
- ðŸŸ¥ Api requests use `http://` in local development. In **production**, all API calls **must use `https://`** for secure communication
- ðŸŸ¥ I tried i use **express-mongo-sanitize** however i could not get it to work, might be something i fix later
- ðŸŸ¥ Google captcha is disabled for now since it keeps going "dormant".

## Deployment & Production Setup

Right now, the app connects to a local MongoDB and supabase instance for development purposes only. To run the app live and securely, follow these steps:

> **Note:** This app is not finished yet, so i don't recommend doing this at the moment. Thins that need configuration for this before trying is https setup for api requests and fetch location.

1. **Host your backend server and frontend**  
   Upload your backend code "server" (e.g., `server.js`, `models/user.js`, `routes/auth.js`, etc.).
   Upload your frontend code "public" (e.g., `index.html`, `assets`, `js`, etc.)

3. **Use a cloud-hosted MongoDB instance**  
   Make sure you have a cloud database set up with MongoDB Atlas or another cloud MongoDB provider. This database is accessible 24/7 and supports secure connections. Your backend should use the connection string stored in the environment variable MONGODB_URI to connect to this cloud database.

4. **Switch API requests to HTTPS in production**  
   Currently, API calls use `http://` for local development. In production, update your frontend API base URL to use `https://` to ensure secure communication with your backend.

5. **Check the code**
   I might have forgotten to mention something since a lot of the fetch calls form localhost, double check the code.

## Next Planned Improvements and Notes

- Connect each template to database to fetch relevant user data for that section

## Recent Update

- Refresh tokens have now been added. ToDoHUB also connects with Supabase for profile picture (pfp) storage, and improved validation logic has been implemented across the app.
- Index does now have somewhat working UI with dark and light mode
- Prettier fix for code layout and space
- Readme changes and roadmap documentation updated 

### What was done:

- **Refresh Tokens Added:**
    - On successful login via the `/login` POST route, an **access token** and a **refresh token** are generated.
    - The access token is short-lived and stored as an **HttpOnly cookie**.
    - The refresh token is securely stored and can be used to request a new access token without logging in again.
    - A `/refresh` endpoint issues a new access token when the old one expires, using the refresh token.

- **Profile Picture Upload with Supabase:**
    - Users can now upload profile pictures, which are stored in a Supabase Storage bucket.
    - Uploaded images use `.webp` format for optimized performance.
    - Supabase returns metadata about the uploaded file (e.g., file path) which is saved with the user.

- **Environment-Specific Config:**
    - Currently set up for local development:
        - `secure: false` â€” allows cookies over HTTP
        - No domain set â€” defaults to `localhost`
    - **Important for production**:
        - `secure: true` â€” only send cookies over HTTPS
        - Proper domain must be configured
        - All API calls should use HTTPS

---

### Why this matters:

- **Refresh tokens** enable seamless, secure session renewal without forcing users to re-login frequently.
- Storing tokens in **HttpOnly cookies** prevents JavaScript access, protecting against XSS attacks.
- Using `SameSite: 'Strict'` and secure cookie settings helps guard against CSRF attacks.
- Backend always validates tokens on protected routes, ensuring users are authenticated before accessing private data.
- Frontend can handle session expiry smoothly (e.g., auto-refresh or redirect to login).
- **Supabase Storage** integration allows scalable and secure profile image handling without bloating the main database.
- These improvements increase **security**, **usability**, and **scalability** of the authentication and user profile system.

## How to Run Locally

1. **Clone the repository**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Sebastian-Inaba/ToDoHub
    cd ToDoHub
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. **Create a `.env` file with the following variables**

    ```
    MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
    JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
    JWT_REFRESH_SECRET=your_jwt_refresh_secret_key

    # Supabase credentials (optional - for profile picture uploads, coming soon)
    SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
